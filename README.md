# ioc order trade bot with coinex api
A trading bot built with Python

# Installation

pip install coinex.py

# How to use?

It is generally recommended to be used in in shallow markets with low volatility. When an order is entered below the amount you set in "bid and ask" price orders, it buys or sells it. It should not be overlooked that such trading bots are generally used by the market maker. Since it is not tied to an indicator, it is not a suitable form of trading for everyone. After the necessary installations are made, you can run the program from the main.py file. At the entry of the program you have to choose whether to buy or sell to start the trade. Or you can develop this bot so that it can trade in both directions at the same time. Thank you.
